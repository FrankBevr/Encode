# Bifrost

an introduction

workshop its hold by tyronejko

bifrost is a parachain on polkadot and kusama.

bifrost is a web3 derivatives protocoall that provided decrantralized cross chain liqzidity for staked assets. By leveraging on the cross consesnsu message it con provided cross chain liquid staking servies for multiple chains.

it has evm pallet implented

Native Token is BNC

it has 84k users

what is the position:

...

if i do staking, token will be locked.
there are stakind problems, security, luqidity cost, cross chain.

tohere is a pallet sits the liqu
That were a bunch of defi terms

### Why built on XCM

Why XCM?

Two blockchains can speak XCM to semleslly interact with each other using a snadnard emssing format

1. speak to each other
2. using a standard messagin format

there is xcm 1 and 2 and the new kid in the block is xcm 3

xcm exist since 2019, kind of a lie, but kind of true.

1. sending assets and messages to a destination chain
2. tretireinb messages from a destination chain.


xcm3 addes message qurey functionality: query_respond. Check the status of messages sent to the other chain.

A nice picture of how it works [Picture](https://i.ibb.co/jWLH6Ls/image.png)

There is SLP and SLP thats the Pallet, the SLP Pallet is important. Thats the unique feature. 

Oh there is another picture [new picture][https://i.ibb.co/7zRQzY0/image.png]
it uses xcm3 and it makes things better, i guess.

there is remining upgrade for v3

why xcm3 makes bifrost uniq
no crentralized risk, quick reaction, cross consensus development

### How to build on Bifrost
base on xcm action

xcm action pallets works fro cross chain vToken minting scenarios, which supports users to minto or redeem vToken on the target chain, cross chain swaps and liquidation.

XCM Action pallet allows builders can build bToken cases on any EVM or WASM compativale parchains. vToken can flows to any consesnsu  parachains via XCM.

There is a SDK for the XCM Action pallets. That sounds need.

#### Benefits to build with bifrost

1. flexibility of choosing evm or wasm copmatible chain to build
2. psoibilty to create multichain use cases
3. share tehc, marketing community ressources with bifrost.

Thanky you very much Herry and Tyron  ðŸ¤— I have to jump off, i should already not anymore sitting here ðŸ™ˆ
